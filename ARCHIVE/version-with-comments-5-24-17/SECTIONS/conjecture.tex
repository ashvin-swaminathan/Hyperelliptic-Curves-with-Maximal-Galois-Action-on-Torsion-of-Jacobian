\section{Conjecture Regarding Maximal Adelic Image of Hyperelliptic Curves}

As we saw in Section~\ref{symbed}, the $\bmod$-$2$ monodromy of a hyperelliptic
curve $y^2 = f(x)$ always lies in the subgroup $S_{2g+2} \subset \Sp_{2g}(\mathbb Z/2 \mathbb Z)$. Further, the $\bmod$-$2$ monodromy will be all of $S_{2g+2}$
if and only if the spitting field of $f(x)$ is as large as possible;
i.e., has Galois group $S_{2g+2}$ over the base field $K$.
In Lemma~\ref{lemma:2-adic}, we saw that for $g = 2$ or $3$,
if the $\bmod$-$2$ monodromy is surjective modulo $2$, then it is surjective
$2$-adically. We conjecture that this pattern continues to hold in higher
genera:
\begin{conjecture}
	\label{conjecture:surjective-mod-2-implies-surjective-2-adically}
	Let $g \geq 2$ and let $H \subset \hypaddict_{2g+2}$ be a closed
	subgroup. If $H(2) = S_{2g+2}$ then $H = \hypaddict_{2g+2}$.
\end{conjecture}
To conclude, we make some remarks on the consequences of this conjecture.
\begin{remark}
	\label{remark:}
	As described in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:reduction-from-adelic-to-mod-l},
	via an easy generalization of the argument given 
	in~\cite[Lemma 3, Section IV.3.4]{serre1989abelian},
	to prove
	Conjecture~\ref{conjecture:surjective-mod-2-implies-surjective-2-adically},
	it suffices to check $\hypaddict_{2g+2}(8) = H(8)$.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
	\label{remark:conjecture-implies-maximal-adelic}
Note that Conjecture~\ref{conjecture:surjective-mod-2-implies-surjective-2-adically}, if true, has the following useful consequence:
If $C$ is a hyperelliptic curve over $\mathbb Q$ with Jacobian $J$ satisfying
$H_J(2) = S_{2g+2}$ and $H_J(\ell) \supset \Sp_{2g}(\mathbb Z/\ell \mathbb Z)$
for every $\ell \geq 3$, then the $C$ has maximal adelic Galois image.
That is, $[\grouphyp{g}{\QQ} : \mono_J] = 2$.

Indeed, granting Conjecture~\ref{conjecture:surjective-mod-2-implies-surjective-2-adically}, this claim follows immediately from Lemma~\ref{lemma:reduction-from-adelic-to-mod-l}.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
	\label{remark:anni-maximal-adelic-examples}
	As follows from Remark~\ref{remark:conjecture-implies-maximal-adelic},
	Conjecture~\ref{conjecture:surjective-mod-2-implies-surjective-2-adically}, would imply that the examples of hyperelliptic
curves with maximal $\bmod$-$\ell$ image constructed in 
\cite[Theorem 7.1]{anni2016residual} in fact have maximal adelic image.
\end{remark}
